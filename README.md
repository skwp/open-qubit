This is an unmaintained archive of an old quantum computing simulation
project that I started while still in high school in 1998-1999.

In its heyday, the project boasted a mailing list of 200, exposure
on Slashdot, a handful of developers, and even a working simulation
of Shor's quantum factorization algorithm.

It's now on github as a museum piece, but if someone wants to pick it up and
hack on it, please, by all means.

If you're feeling adventurous, try to compile it. I haven't tried, so I have no
idea if it compiles :)

Thanks!
