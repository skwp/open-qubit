just type 'make'
to clean the tree, type 'make clean'
to make the docs type 'make docs'. then see doc/index.html
to run type './shor'

if you want debugging info (not recommended unless you know what
you are doing) edit the Makefile and uncomment '-DNODEBUG'

there is currently no 'make install' implemented as these releases
are by no means final products, and are meant for testing purposes
only.
